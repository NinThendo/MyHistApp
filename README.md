My History App report 

 

App User interface 

 

 

For the user interface i made a background using the canva website. For the layout i decided to have the buttons located close to each other at the bottom so the user doesn’t need to do a handful of movements to use these two functions. The EditText for the users input is located just above the two buttons on the project ui. 

 

This image displays the ui screen after the user has entered a valid age into the EditText. This resulted in one of the 10 historians being named and information about them which is included for each one. In this image the result showed MLK. 

 

For this image the result shown is when a user enters a value that isn’t included in the range so a message will be displayed to inform our user that we do not have any data on someone who is a historical figure that died at the age of 20. 

 

In this image the user entered a string(words) into the EditText and so the textview outputed a response to tell the user that his or her input is not valid as it is not in the correct format and it should be in the range from twenty to one hundred. 

 

Age classification logic 

For my age classification i followed the guide and had there be a limited range from 20 to 100. A few historical figures i included in my app were Genghis Khan and Donatello.  

 

Error handling 

For the code the app will check for 3 errors. The first error is whether the input is empty once the search button has been clicked. The second will check if the input from the user is in a valid format, that being an integer (number). The last check is whether the value entered is in the predetermined range. If the first scenario is triggered the message displayed will tell the user that the entered value is either empty or doesn’t meet the range requirements. For the second scenario the user will be told that they have entered an invalid input and that they need to ensure whatever they enter is in the right format and in the range. 

Clear button 

For the clear button the code simply removes all text from the textbox and from the edittext. 

Search button 

A search button is a user interface element that, when clicked or pressed, initiates a search query with the text or parameters entered in the associated search bar. Its function is to start the process of searching for information or content that matches the user's input. This allows users to quickly and easily find relevant results without having to navigate through multiple pages or menus. Search buttons are commonly found on websites, applications, and operating systems, and are essential for efficient information retrieval. 

For the search button the code under it contains mainly if statements. At the first if statement there will be a check to see that the EditText is not empty and that whatever is entered fits in the range of 20 to 100.  

App considerations 

The first thing to consider for the app was checking for errors. The details for this were covered in the error handling section. Next was loading all the historians fun facts into the if statements for when the correct age was inputted into the EditText. Next I designed the background for my app using canva to design it. Finally i had to change the button and ui layout to something i felt would be comfortable to use and not require too many movements from the user side which should be ergonomically useful. After taking all these into consideration I was able to create my finished app and submit it to GitHub.
